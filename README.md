🔍 Delving into Depression and Mental Health Data Analysis with Power BI! 📊
🧠 Embarking on my maiden voyage into Power BI, I've ventured into the intricate world of Depression and Mental Health Data Analysis. With an aim to shed light on this crucial aspect of human well-being, I've crafted a project that strives to unravel insights from raw data.

📈 In my debut project, I've meticulously designed two dynamic pages. The first page serves as a visual gateway, where I've employed diverse visuals including lines, funnels, matrices, and slicers. These visuals not only present the data in an accessible manner but also dynamically adapt to the user's selections. Through the magic of Power BI, every click on the slicer or matrix triggers a transformation in the visuals, offering a tailored perspective on the dataset.

💡 Moving onto the second page, I've continued the exploration with two additional visuals and insightful cards. Similar to the first page, these visuals respond to user input, ensuring a personalized analytical journey. Additionally, I've integrated formulas to quantify male quarantine frustrations, providing nuanced insights into this specific aspect of mental health.
